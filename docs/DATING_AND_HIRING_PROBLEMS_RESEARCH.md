## Dating Problems: The Current State

### Key Statistics

**User Dissatisfaction:**
- **78% of Gen Z users** report feeling emotionally exhausted by online dating
- **40%** cite the inability to find a good connection as the primary source of exhaustion
- **Only 11% of users** believe their app is good at matching them with compatible people
- **63% of frequent dating app users** feel lonely (compared to 48% of offline daters)

**Safety Concerns:**
- **55% of online daters** encounter threats or scams
- **$141 million+** in romance fraud losses annually in the U.S.
- AI-driven catfishing makes scams harder to detect

**Industry Decline:**
- Dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble experienced user decline between May 2023 and May 2024

### Core Problems

1. **Ineffective Matching Algorithms**: Traditional apps use superficial matching (photos, basic preferences) that fails to capture true compatibility
2. **Gamification Over Connection**: Apps designed for engagement, not authentic relationships
3. **Privacy and Safety Risks**: Data harvesting, fake profiles, scams, and harassment
4. **Emotional Exhaustion**: Endless swiping without meaningful connections
5. **Isolation Despite Connection**: More time on apps correlates with increased loneliness
