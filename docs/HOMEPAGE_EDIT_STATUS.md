## Next Steps

**Note:** Squarespace editing via Playwright is complex due to:
- Content editing in iframe
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Complex DOM structure for block editing

**Recommendation:** 
1. Manual editing through Squarespace interface may be more reliable
2. Use this document as a reference guide
3. Follow HOME_PAGE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md for exact content

**Alternative:** If you want to continue with Playwright automation, we can attempt to:
- Click specific text blocks to edit
- Use JavaScript injection to modify content
- However, this approach is fragile and may not work reliably
