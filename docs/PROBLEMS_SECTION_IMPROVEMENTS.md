# Problems Section Improvements

**Created:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Proposed improvements for "The Problems Avrai Solves" section  
**Status:** Recommendations for review

---

## Current Issues

1. **Redundant Opening**: The opening paragraph about loneliness is repeated in Crisis #1
2. **Duplicate Content**: "AVRAI helps you" list overlaps with "How AVRAI Solves These" list
3. **Long Solutions List**: 12+ solution items can be overwhelming
4. **Structure Flow**: Problem → Solution flow could be clearer
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Could benefit from better organization

---

**Structure:**

**Content:**

**Opening:**
```
America faces seven interconnected crises that make it harder to find belonging, make decisions, and build authentic connections. AVRAI addresses them all.
```
