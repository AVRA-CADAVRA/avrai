## Implementation Steps

### STEP 1: Update Hero Section

**Location:** Top of page (currently shows "Revolutionizing the Tech Landscape")

**Action:**
1. Click on the heading "Revolutionizing the Tech Landscape"
2. Replace with:

```
Find Your People, Your Places, Your Life
```

**Then add subheadline (in a text block below or as paragraph):**

```
AVRAI is an AI-powered app that helps you discover meaningful places, build authentic communities, and find belonging—all while keeping your personal data private on your device.
```

**Add CTA Button:**
- Button text: `Join the Waitlist`
- Link: (you'll need to set up a waitlist form/page - see note below)

**Add small text below button:**
```
⚠️ Technology protected by 31+ patent-pending innovations
```

**Note:** For the waitlist button, you'll need to either:
- Create a waitlist form in Squarespace and link to it
- Link to an external waitlist (e.g., Google Forms, Mailchimp)
- Use a Squarespace form block

---

### STEP 2: Add "What is AVRAI?" Section

**Location:** Add new section after hero

**Action:** Add a new Text block or Section

**Heading:**
```
There is no secret to life. Just doors that haven't been opened yet.
```

**Body Text:**
```
AVRAI (Authentic Value Recognition Application) is the key that helps you open those doors. Every spot is a door—to experiences, to communities, to people, to meaning, to more doors.

**The Journey:** Spots → Community → Life

You discover your favorite spots. Those spots have communities. Those communities have events. Through AVRAI, you find your people and enrich your life.

**AVRAI just provides access. You decide which doors to open.**
```

---

### STEP 3: Replace Services Section with "How It Works"

**Location:** Current "Discover our services" section (with 3 products)

**Action:** 
1. **Remove** the 3 product blocks (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced services)
2. **Delete** the "Discover our services" heading
3. **Add** new 3-column section (or use Squarespace layout block)

**Heading:**
```
Privacy-First AI That Learns With You
```

**Column 1:**
```
🔐 Your AI Learns On-Device

Your personal AI learns your preferences privately on your phone. All your personal data stays on your device—never shared, never sold.
```

**Column 2:**
```
🤝 AIs Connect Peer-to-Peer

Your AI talks to other AIs via Bluetooth or local network (no internet needed). They exchange anonymous "vibe signatures" to find compatible people and places—but never share who you are.
```

**Column 3:**
```
✨ Discover in Real-Time

Find compatible people and places instantly, anywhere. Works offline, syncs when connected. The more you use it, the smarter it gets—without compromising your privacy.
```

**Note at bottom of section:**
```
*All technologies described above are proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.
```

### STEP 4: Add "Advanced Features: Quantum Knots & String Theory" Section

**Location:** Add new section after "How It Works"

**Action:** Add new section with heading and 4 feature cards

**Heading:**
```
The Science Behind the Magic: Quantum Knots & String Theory
```

**Introduction Paragraph:**
```
AVRAI uses cutting-edge mathematics inspired by quantum physics and topological knot theory to create the most accurate personality matching system ever built. Here's how it works:

⚠️ **All features described below are proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.**
```

**Card 1: Topological Personality Knots**
```
🧬 Your Personality as a Topological Knot
⚠️ Patent #31 (Patent Pending)

Your personality isn't just numbers—it's a unique topological structure. AVRAI represents your personality dimensions as a mathematical knot, capturing how your traits connect and influence each other. Just like no two snowflakes are alike, no two personality knots are identical.

This topological representation reveals deeper compatibility patterns that simple matching can't detect.

⚠️ This technology is proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.
```

**Card 2: Knot Evolution Strings**
```
📈 Personality Evolution Over Time
⚠️ Patent Pending

Your personality evolves as you grow. AVRAI tracks this evolution using "knot strings"—mathematical representations that show how your personality changes over time. The system can predict how compatible you'll be with places and people in the future, not just today.

Think of it like a timeline of your personal growth, encoded in elegant mathematical structures.

⚠️ This technology is proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.
```

**Card 3: Knot Fabric for Groups**
```
👥 Community as Woven Fabric
⚠️ Patent Pending

When groups of friends or communities form, their individual personality knots weave together into a "knot fabric"—a unified mathematical structure representing group compatibility. This helps AVRAI find spots where everyone in your group will enjoy going, not just where one person would like.

It's like seeing how individual threads create a beautiful tapestry of compatibility.

⚠️ This technology is proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.
```

**Card 4: 4D Quantum Worldsheets**
```
🌌 Group Evolution in 4D Space
⚠️ Patent Pending

For groups and communities, AVRAI uses 4-dimensional "quantum worldsheets" to track how group dynamics evolve over time. This advanced mathematical framework (inspired by string theory) allows the system to understand not just who you're compatible with now, but how groups form, grow, and evolve.

It's like having a time machine for understanding group compatibility.

⚠️ This technology is proprietary and protected by patent-pending applications.
```

**Closing Statement:**
```
These advanced mathematical frameworks—inspired by quantum physics, knot theory, and string theory—enable AVRAI to understand personality and compatibility at a deeper level than any other system. But you don't need to understand the math to benefit from it. You just need to know it works.

⚠️ **All technologies, algorithms, and mathematical frameworks described above are proprietary intellectual property of AVRAI and are protected by 31+ patent-pending applications. Unauthorized use, copying, or implementation is strictly prohibited.**
```
