## 🎯 **Precise Statement**

> **"AVRAI demonstrates superior matching accuracy (+10% to +209%) compared to modern ML systems (Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Graph Neural Networks, Neural Collaborative Filtering) and simple quantum-based matching. AVRAI provides competitive prediction accuracy (+24% to +36% vs Matrix Factorization/Graph Neural Networks) while offering unique capabilities (knot topology, temporal evolution, fabric stability) not available in classical ML systems. Compared to established prior art (Match Group patents), AVRAI shows 5-57% improvement in matching accuracy and prediction error reduction."**

- Interactions are simulated (not real user behavior)
- Real-world validation needed for production claims

### **4. Comparison Scope:**
- Not compared against all possible ML systems
- Focus on established methods (CF, MF, GNN, NCF)
- Future comparisons with transformer-based models recommended
