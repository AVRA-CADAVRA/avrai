- **In-progress tasks are LOCKED** - No new tasks can be added to Phase 5 weeks
- **Master Plan updated** - Phase 5 weeks show "🟡 IN PROGRESS - Tasks assigned to agents"
- **Status Tracker updated** - Agent assignments documented

**Before adding ANY new task to Phase 5:**
- ✅ Check Master Plan week status
- ✅ Verify week shows "🟢 Ready to Start" (not "🟡 In Progress")
- ✅ Verify no task assignments document exists
- ✅ If tasks are assigned (document exists), use a different week or wait for completion
